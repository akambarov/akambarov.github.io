Although I'm not really the one to give any advice on building something (for now), I think this is the best advice on how to start building:

Start with:
- a problem _YOU_ personally have or have seen others struggle with
- a tool that takes 10+ clicks elsewhere but could take just 1 in yours

Then:
- build an MVP in a few days or over a weekend using Cursor, Claude, etc.
- share it on X, Product Hunt, Reddit, etc.
- iterate based on user feedback
- don't worry about monetization AT ALL initially
